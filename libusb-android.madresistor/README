libusb
======

libusb is a library for USB device access from Linux, Mac OS X,
Windows, OpenBSD/NetBSD and Haiku userspace.
It is written in C (Haiku backend in C++) and licensed under the GNU
Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or, at your option, any later
version (see COPYING).

libusb is abstracted internally in such a way that it can hopefully
be ported to other operating systems. Please see the PORTING file
for more information.

How To for Android
==================

1. Search for the UsbDevice [1] you are interested in.
2. Extract the usbfs path [2] from the UsbDevice.
3. Build a libbox0_device from the path
    using libusb_get_device2(context, path) [3]
4. open the UsbDevice [4], you will get UsbDeviceConnection [5].
5. from the UsbDeviceConnection, extract the fd[6]
6. now, from the fd and the previously
    created libusb_device, build a libusb_device_handle
    by calling libusb_get_device2(dev, handle, fd)[7].
7. and that all you need.
